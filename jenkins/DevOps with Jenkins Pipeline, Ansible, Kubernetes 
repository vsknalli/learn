Jenkins:

Jenkins is popular Automatin tool for Continuouse integration and Continuouse Delivery 
we have similar tools like 
Bamboo
Circle CI 
Solano CI 
Team Ciry and etc...
Using jenkins we can automate any kind of taks not only ci and cd Automation ,  
Jenkins is Open source
Jenkins written in java
Basically jenkins is collection of plugins , All the features implemented in jenkins via 
plugins, using plugins we can extend the features of jenkins.

Continuouse integration process is the development practice, Where set of developers do 
source code changes regularly and they push the changes into source code repositories like Git, 
After this there is going to be automated process which pics all the changes committed by 
developers and it runs this code through some verification like 
                * compiles the code 
                * Test the Code
                * It also performs static code analysis like using sonarQube
                  (blockers, errors & warnings),Then every thing goes well 
                * It going to create a software package which is used for deployment 
                if something goed wrong then this automated process sends some kind of notifications to the developers 
                * continuese integration is the common pratice in devops workflow 
                Benifies:
                =========
                * Fast feedback to the developers
                * Easy for developers to find and fix issues 
                * improves developers prodectiviry 
                * Improves code quality, minimize defects
                * Its automates integration flow 

why we need master slave architecture in jenkins?

1) I want to scale my jenkins by distributing jobs accros multiple machines , means i want run more concerent jobs in jenkins, so i can spread that workload accross multiple slaves sicne i can scale jenkins 

2) I want to build .net application i need .net platform and for some appliation i need 
docker or linux or Terraform or any other platform , so we have diffrent agents with different evironment setup , 


Master Slave configuraiton:
===========================
    New Node--> Permanent Agent--> Description--> Number of executors
    Remote Workspace  --> /opt/build
    Labels: java-buildnode
    Launch Method --> 1) Launch agent by connecting to the controller - we slect 1 option
                      2) Launch agent via controller Node
                      3) Launch via SSH
    Slect websocket method
    Availability: Keep this agent as much as possible (allways up and running) and save.

Now we need to copy the agent which is download during we select Lunch method option 1
Now copy some command syntax from ServerGui and past it in slave 
copy Agent in the same /opt/workspace and execute the copied syntax from Server Gui.

Need to slect the job configuration "Need to run on option" to run this any job 


Pipeline :
===========
Node  --> Represents a machine on which the work is done
stpes  --> Fundamentally step tells jenkins what to do 
Stage  --> Stage is collection of steps

Maven Phase
============
A Maven phase represents a stage in the Maven build 
 lifecycle. Each phase is responsible for a specific task.

validate: check if all information necessary for the build is available
compile: compile the source code
test-compile: compile the test source code
test: run unit tests
package: package compiled source code into the distributable format (jar, war, â€¦)
integration-test: process and deploy the package if needed to run integration tests
install: install the package to a local repository
deploy: copy the package to the remote repository

How to define a variable in groovy?
node {
    def name = "senthil"
    echo "Welcome to jenkins ${name}"
}
This is called string interpolation , the sring should be in double quotes

1) First Pipeline example
==========================
node{
    echo "Welcome to jenkins pipeline"
}

2) Jenkins pipeline jobs Integration with Git and Maven
While running pipeline script we have two options 
1. Pipeline Script
2. Pipeline script from SCM
